# QuickSRNet
This document describes how to run AIMET quantization on the following model(s) and verify the performance of the quantized models. 

---

## Environment Setup

### 1. Setup AI Model Efficiency Toolkit
Please [install and setup AIMET](https://github.com/quic/aimet/blob/release-aimet-1.23/packaging/install.md) before proceeding further. This model was tested with the `torch_gpu` variant of AIMET version 1.23.0.

### 2. Install AIMET-Model-Zoo
Clone the AIMET Model Zoo repo into your workspace:  
`git clone https://github.com/quic/aimet-model-zoo.git`  
`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path to parent of aimet_model_zoo>`  

### 3. Download dataset
Download the *Set14 Super Resolution Dataset* from here: https://deepai.org/dataset/set14-super-resolution to any location in your workspace.

Extract the *set5.zip* file, then the *SR_testing_datasets.zip* found within.

The images of interest are located in the following path:  
`<root-path>/set5/SR_testing_datasets/Set14`

## Running Evaluation

To run evaluation with QuantSim in AIMET, use the following
```bash
 python3  aimet_zoo_torch/quicksrnet/evaluators/quicksrnet_quanteval.py \
                --model-config <configuration to be tested> \
                --dataset-path <path to directory containing High Resolution (ground truth) images>
```

Available model configurations are:
- quicksrnet_small_1.5x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_small_2x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_small_3x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_small_4x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_medium_1.5x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_medium_2x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_medium_3x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_medium_4x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_large_1.5x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_large_2x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_large_3x_w8a8
- quicksrnet_large_4x_w8a8

## Models
Model checkpoints are available in the [Releases](/../../releases) page.

Please note the following regarding the available checkpoints:
- All model architectures were reimplemented from scratch and trained on the *DIV2k* dataset (available [here](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/)).
- The *float32* model is the full-precision model with the highest validation accuracy on the DIV2k dataset.
- The *int8* model is the quantized model with the highest validation accuracy obtained using AIMET's [Quantization-aware Training](https://developer.qualcomm.com/blog/exploring-aimet-s-quantization-aware-training-functionality).
- The above quantized model along with the Encodings were exported using AIMET's export tool.

## Quantization Configuration
In the evaluation notebook included, we have used the default config file, which configures the quantizer ops with the following assumptions:
- Weight quantization: *8 bits, per tensor symmetric quantization*
- Bias parameters are not quantized
- Activation quantization: *8 bits, asymmetric quantization*
- Model inputs are quantized
- *TF_enhanced* was used as the quantization scheme

## Results
**NOTE:**
All results below used a *Scaling factor (LR-to-HR upscaling) of 2x* and the *Set14 dataset*.
